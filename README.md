#  Why did we build this Todo App?
### Our team built this app in order:
* to let the users enter the tasks they need to do into a web page so that they don't forget them
* to view the tasks they have added in a list so that they can plan their day
* to mark tasks as completed so that they can focus on the tasks they have left
<br/><br/>


# What does our Todo App have?
### Our app has four buttons:
1- add button 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
2- delete button
<br>
3- mark button
&nbsp; &nbsp;
4- sort button
<br/><br/>


# How was our team journey through building this blog?
**First,** &nbsp; we drew a sketch as a first plan for our Todo App<br>
**Second,** &nbsp; we discussed our plan together and edited it. <br>
**Third,** &nbsp; we drew the final layout. <br>
**Forth,** &nbsp; we divided the four buttons on our team members, we worked in pairs and then we changed the pairs. <br>
**Fifth,** &nbsp; each pair used TDD to create the logic needed to modify its buttons. <br>
**Sixth,** &nbsp; team members rendered the to-do list to the DOM.
**Seventh,** &nbsp; members helped each other to solve the problems they faced. <br>
**Eighth,** &nbsp;conflicts started to appear, so we worked on solving them.<br>
**Ninth,** &nbsp; the team added their own features <br>
**last,** &nbsp; team submitted their work.
